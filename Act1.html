    <h1>What is Your Purpose in Life?</h1>

    <p class="quote">
        "The meaning of life is not something you find. It is something you create."
    </p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            We often ask ourselves, "Why am I here?" The truth is, purpose is not givenâ€”it is discovered through our actions, passions, and the people we impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your purpose might be to create, to inspire, to teach, to love, or to simply bring happiness to those around you. What matters is not the size of your purpose, but the depth of your commitment to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every day is a chance to take a step toward your purpose. What will you do today that brings meaning to your life?
        </p>
    </div>

    <p class="footer">Live with purpose. Make every moment count.</p>
